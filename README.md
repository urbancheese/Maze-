Maze Solver in C
This is a fun little project that generates and solves mazes using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). You can make your own maze or have the program generate a random one. Then, just sit back and watch as it finds the path for you!

What It Does
Generate Mazes: Make a random maze by specifying the size.
Input Your Own Maze: If you're feeling creative, you can also input your maze with these characters:
# for walls
for paths
S for start
E for end
Solve Mazes: Choose between two algorithms to solve it:
DFS: Goes as deep as it can before backtracking.
BFS: Explores layer by layer.
Cool Visuals: Youâ€™ll see the maze solving live with different colors for the start, end, walls, and path.
